   - Search by partial patient name
   - Handle no results scenarios
   - Clear search functionality

3. **Network Error Handling**
   - Display network error alerts
   - Provide retry functionality
   - Maintain application stability during network issues

   - Maintain language persistence across navigation
   - Translate UI elements and content
   - Handle error messages in selected language

## Technology Stack

- **Cypress**: End-to-end testing framework
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD pipeline
- **Page Object Model**: Test organization pattern

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd UpHillSolution
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   The test credentials are already configured in the cypress.env.js file:
   - Username: --
   - Password: --

## Running Tests

### Interactive Mode (Cypress GUI)
```bash
npm run cypress:open
```
This opens the Cypress Test Runner where you can:
- See all test files
- Run individual tests
- Debug test execution
- View real-time browser interactions

### Headless Mode (Command Line)
```bash
npm run cypress:run
```
This runs all tests in headless mode, suitable for CI/CD pipelines.

### Run Specific Test Suites
```bash
# Run only patient journey tests
npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/patient-journeys/**"

# Run only localization tests
npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/localization/**"

# Run specific test file
npm run cypress:run -- --spec "cypress/e2e/patient-journeys/search.cy.js"
```

### Run Tests in Different Browsers
```bash
# Chrome (default)
npm run cypress:run -- --browser chrome

# Firefox
npm run cypress:run -- --browser firefox

# Edge
npm run cypress:run -- --browser edge
```



### Test Data Management
- Synthetic patient data for testing
- Configurable test fixtures

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The repository includes a comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow that:

- Runs tests on pull requests
- Tests across multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Tests both language versions (EN, PT)
- Generates test reports and screenshots
- Provides test failure notifications

### Workflow Features
- **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel for faster feedback
- **Cross-Browser Testing**: Ensures compatibility across browsers
- **Artifact Collection**: Screenshots and videos on failure
- **Slack/Email Notifications**: Alert team on test failures

## Test Reports

### Cypress Dashboard
Test results are available in the Cypress Dashboard with:
- Test execution history
- Performance metrics
- Failure analysis
- Screenshots and videos

### Custom Reporting
- HTML test reports
- JUnit XML for CI integration
- Custom healthcare-specific metrics

## Healthcare-Specific Considerations

### Patient Data Privacy
- All tests use synthetic, HIPAA-compliant data
- No real patient information is used
- Test data is automatically cleaned up

### Accessibility Testing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation testing

### Performance Standards
- Healthcare application performance requirements
- Mobile device compatibility
- Slow network condition testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Login Failures**
   ```bash
   # Verify credentials are correct
   # Check if test environment is accessible
   # Clear browser cache and cookies
   ```

2. **Element Not Found Errors**
   ```bash
   # Update selectors in page objects
   # Increase timeout values for slow loading
   # Check if UI has changed
   ```

3. **Network-Related Test Failures**
   ```bash
   # Verify test environment connectivity
   # Check for API endpoint changes
   # Review network stubbing configuration
   ```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Run with debug logging
DEBUG=cypress:* npm run cypress:run

# Open browser dev tools during test
cy.debug()

# Pause test execution
cy.pause()
```

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests

1. **Create test file** in appropriate directory
2. **Follow naming convention**: `feature-name.cy.js`
3. **Use Page Object Model** for UI interactions
4. **Include BDD-style descriptions**
5. **Add appropriate assertions**

### Test Writing Guidelines

```javascript
describe('Feature Name - Specific Functionality', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.login()
    cy.navigateToPatientJourneys()
  })

  it('should perform expected behavior when condition is met', () => {
    // Given - setup
    // When - action
    // Then - assertion
  })
})
```

### Code Quality Standards
- ESLint configuration for consistent code style
- Prettier for code formatting
- Meaningful test descriptions
- Comprehensive error handling

## Future Test Cases (BDD Format)

### Advanced Patient Search
```gherkin
Feature: Advanced Patient Search
  As a healthcare professional
  I want to search patients using multiple criteria
  So that I can quickly find relevant patient information

  Scenario: Search patients by multiple filters
    Given I am on the Patient Journeys page
    When I apply multiple search filters
    And I search for patients with specific criteria
    Then I should see patients matching all criteria

  Scenario: Save search preferences
    Given I have configured custom search filters
    When I save my search preferences
    Then my preferences should be available for future sessions
```

### Bulk Patient Operations
```gherkin
Feature: Bulk Patient Operations
  As a healthcare professional
  I want to perform actions on multiple patients
  So that I can efficiently manage patient journeys

  Scenario: Select multiple patients
    Given I am viewing a list of patients
    When I select multiple patients using checkboxes
    Then I should see bulk action options

  Scenario: Update communication status for multiple patients
    Given I have selected multiple patients
    When I choose to update their communication status
    Then all selected patients should have their status updated
```

### Real-time Updates
```gherkin
Feature: Real-time Patient Updates
  As a healthcare professional
  I want to see real-time updates to patient information
  So that I have the most current patient data

  Scenario: Receive real-time patient status updates
    Given I am viewing patient journeys
    When a patient's status is updated by another user
    Then I should see the updated status without refreshing

  Scenario: Handle concurrent user modifications
    Given multiple users are accessing the same patient
    When concurrent modifications occur
    Then the system should handle conflicts gracefully
```

## Performance Metrics
